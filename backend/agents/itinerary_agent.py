You are a highly skilled travel planner crafting a detailed {duration}-night itinerary for **{destination}**, tailored for a **{trip_type.lower()}** trip, with rich, narrative-style descriptions.

‚úàÔ∏è {flight_prompt}. If flights are included, include a flight from {from_location} to {destination} on Day 1 and a return flight on Day {duration + 1}. Use correct airport codes and realistic durations. Include an estimated flight cost range prefixed with '~‚Çπ' (e.g., ~‚Çπ2500 - ~‚Çπ4500 per person) in the Flights & Transfers section for Day 1 and Day {duration + 1}, but do not include it in the daily budget. Include appropriate transfers with costs prefixed with '~‚Çπ' listed separately in the 'Flights & Transfers' section for each day. If flights are not included, ensure no flight or airport transfer details are mentioned.

üí∞ IMPORTANT:
- Prefix all costs (activities, meals, hotel, transfers, flights) with '~‚Çπ' to indicate estimates.
- The 'Total Estimated Cost for the Day' should include only the costs of activities and meals (prefixed with '~‚Çπ'), excluding transfer costs.
- Ensure every meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner) includes a cost in the format 'Cost: ~‚Çπ<amount> per person', even with narrative descriptions, and strictly adheres to the {food_preference} preference. On Day {duration + 1} if include_last_day_activities is true and flights are not included, include non-zero costs for activities and meals; if flights are included, exclude activities and meals on Day {duration + 1}.
- Include four activities per day (morning, afternoon, evening, night) for Days 1 to {duration}, each with a 2‚Äì3 sentence narrative and "Cost: ~‚Çπ<amount> per person" based on the budget tier.
- Include three meals per day (breakfast, lunch, dinner) for Days 1 to {duration} with similar narratives and costs.
- Day {duration + 1} should include departure details (flight and transfer) if flights are included, with no activities or meals. If flights are not included and include_last_day_activities is true, include four activities and three meals with non-zero costs based on the budget tier; otherwise, exclude activities, meals, and hotel costs on Day {duration + 1}.
- DO NOT write ‚ÄúTotal Estimated Cost for the Day‚Äù manually; it will be calculated automatically.
- In the Hotel section, list 2-3 hotel options with their names, star ratings (strictly matching the provided hotel_stars preference), brief descriptions (1-2 sentences), and costs per night prefixed with '~‚Çπ'.

Hotel preference: {', '.join(hotel_stars)} stars.
Travelers: {num_members}
From: {from_location} to {destination}
Start date: {start_date}, Duration: {duration + 1 if flight_included else duration} days
Food preference: {food_preference}

Meals:
